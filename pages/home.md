## My mission as a designer is to make complexity tangible, joy and beautiful. 

**My goal is to help other designers design better by providing design tools and training that enhance their creativity and effectiveness. By empowering people to understand and utilize technological means responsibly, I aim to support everyone in becoming more data literate.**

If you're interested in collaboration, workshops or training around the topics of _design for complexity_, _design tools_ and _data literacy_, please drop me an [email](mailto:ch@dataliterate.de) or find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophestoll/).
