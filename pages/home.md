## My mission as a designer is to make complexity tangible, joy and beautiful. 

**My goal is to help other designers design better by providing design tools and training that enhance their creativity and effectiveness. By empowering people to understand and utilize technological means responsibly, I aim to support everyone in becoming more data literate.**

If you're interested in collaboration, workshops or training around the topics of _design for complexity_, _design tools_ and _data literacy_, please drop me an [email](mailto:ch@dataliterate.de) or find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophestoll/) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nitrada/).

I'm also a musician, producing electronic music as _nitrada_. You can find my music on [Bandcamp](https://nitrada.bandcamp.com), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/nitrada), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6oD3H0RjGD2jNOKwjhyPJW), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nitrada/5526621) or have a look at my latest [audio-visual series](https://www.nitrada.com/max-for-live). I'm currently working on a new record, which will be released in early 2025.
