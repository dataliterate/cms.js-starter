## Crafting Experiences, Embracing Complexity

For 25 years, I've immersed myself in the world of design. Though I didn't attend design school initially, I've since bridged that gap by collaborating with students as a lecturer and mentor, sharing my real-world experience.  
  
My portfolio spans a diverse range of projects:  
  
* Tangible artifacts: record covers, visual identities (eg for conferences)
* Experiences: product and interaction design for music, editorial or business software
* Conceptual work: design systems for products, services, and platforms
* Educational initiatives: design teaching assignments
* Design tools: creating tools to help designers design better
  
Whether it's called user experience design, interaction design, product design, or design consulting, I approach each project with equal passion for both the thinking behind it and the craft itself.

### Curiosity & Collaboration

I'm driven by curiosity and an insatiable urge to learn, fueled by exploration and experimentation. My comfort zone is having more questions than answers in mind. I love unexpected results. Solutions that put a smile on faces.

I thrive on collaboration, working with:  
  
* Fellow designers
* Professionals from related disciplines
* Business stakeholders
* Customers and consumers
* Machines

### My approach

Sharing my experience is a joy, but I'm equally driven by an insatiable curiosity to learn. I welcome debate about design, viewing it as a source of positive friction that drives innovation.  
  
In my work, I aim to:  
  
* Think like an entrepreneur
* Listen like a therapist
* Experiment like a scientist
* Lead by example
* Empathize deeply with the people I design for and with

### My mission

As a designer, I see my mission as:  
  
* Make complexity tangible, joy and beautiful
* Help other designers design better by providing design tools and training that enhance their creativity and effectiveness
* Empower people to understand and utilize technological means responsibly
* Foster meaningful human-machine collaboration
* Support everyone in becoming more data literate

Looking ahead, I believe the next 25 years will be both very challenging and wonderful. I'm excited to continue growing, learning, and making a positive impact through design.
