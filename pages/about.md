## Crafting Experiences, Embracing Complexity
For 25 years, I've immersed myself in the world of design. Though I didn't attend design school initially, I've since bridged that gap by collaborating with students as a lecturer and mentor, sharing my real-world experience. 

My portfolio spans a diverse range of projects:

1. Tangible artifacts: record covers, visual identities (eg for conferences) 
2. Conceptual work: design systems for products, services, and platforms 
3. Educational initiatives: design teaching assignments 
4. Design tools: creating tools to help designers design better 

Whether it's called user experience design, interaction design, product design, or design consulting, I approach each project with equal passion for both the thinking behind it and the craft itself. 

### Collaboration
I thrive on collaboration, working with:

1. Fellow designers
2. Professionals from related disciplines
3. Business stakeholders
4. Customers and consumers

### Approach
Sharing my experience is a joy, but I'm equally driven by an insatiable curiosity to learn. I welcome debate about design, viewing it as a source of positive friction that drives innovation.

In my work, I aim to:

1. Think like an entrepreneur
2. Listen like a therapist
3. Lead by example
4. Empathize deeply with the people I design for and with

### Mission
As a designer, I see my mission as:

1. Making complexity graspable and beautiful
2. Creating happiness through design
3. Contributing to a better world for all living things (including my beloved ==cats==, trees and brutalist buildings)

Looking ahead, I believe the next 25 years will be both very challenging and wonderful. I'm excited to continue growing, learning, and making a positive impact through design. ♥️
